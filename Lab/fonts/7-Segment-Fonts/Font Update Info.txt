7 Segment Fonts V1.02; May 13, 2005

I originally created the "7 Segment Fonts" in 2002 and they seemed
to work fine with the latest version of Windows.

However since finding some users having problems on the more recent
Windows versions I've had to make corrections.

The problem seemed to be that the "Left-Hand Side" of the characters
were getting cut off. I've adjusted the "Kerning" ( i.e. the spacing
between characters ) which seems to have fixed the problem.

They perform OK now ( May 2005 ) using:

Windows XP - SP2
Microsoft Office Word 2003

However if you experience any other problems please contact me.

Thank you.
